Simulation code for the paper "Simulating complex networks in phase space: Gaussian boson sampling" by P. D. Drummond, B. Opanchuk, and M. D. Reid, [arXiv:2102.10341](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10341).

The CPU part is a direct port of the reference Matlab code written by P. D. Drummond (to be published).

The code models an experiment analogous to the one from "Quantum computational advantage using photons" (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6523/1460).
